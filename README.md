## Villagers: A fake social network for teachers, parents, and students

### Philosophy
In the U.S., parents and teachers collaborate every day for their students, but rarely through direct communication. In fact, they have often never met. Teachers should have an easy way to request assistance from home when the class or specific students needs it, and parents deserve to be kept in the loop about their student's situation at school.

### Goals
This program is meant to sketch out a solution to the above problem, not be the solution. It makes the assumption that parents, students, and teachers have their accounts created by the school, who also confirms their identities. Therefore, there are no accounts for <i>you</i>, the reader: you can enter a fake parent account and a fake teacher account, and understand how the application attempts to solve the problems of both parties.
